          Our community outreach began in October 2021 in response to the impact
          of COVID-19. We started by donating 500 pairs of sneakers to whānau
          and rangatahi in need. Through our flagship kaupapa, 'Outsole', we
          deepened our understanding of community needs. In 2022, we expanded
          our services with two key programs. 'Kumete' focuses on mental health
          and wellbeing, offering empowering wānanga and workshops. 'Elevate' is
          our mentorship program, helping young adults build financial acumen
          and connect with mentors across various industries and career paths.

                    We are a population-focused organisation and have an
                    interest in the overall outcomes of Pacific peoples across
                    Aotearoa, underserved and South Auckland communities. We
                    work upstream to address the causes of complex problems and
                    downstream to strengthen prevention systems. This is
                    achieved by delivering a range of services to communities,
                    clinical and provider networks and to our delivery partners.
